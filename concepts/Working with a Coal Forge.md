When selecting/building a forge, the biggest decision to make is the fuel source. Gas forges are cheaper and cleaner, but coal forges are able to reach much higher temps (like the kind you need for [forge welding](./Forge%20Welding.md)).

## How does a coal forge work?
The coal forge is fueled by converting coal into coke, which then burns in an oxidation reaction releasing heat and light. The conversion reaction releases flammable (and carcinogenic) gasses, ash, and "other crap" (largely silica) which condenses into a glassy substance called clink.

This "other crap" stems from the origin of coal: ancient forests from a time before bacteria had evolved to break down their fallen trunks. Trees are made up of a lot more than just carbon and hydrogen, and all of that stuff is trapped in the coal.

## Coal, Coke, and Clink - Oh My!
Operating a coal forge requires managing these processes and their byproducts. Here are key points to keep in mind:
- You need to be regularly feeding fresh coal into the forge to produce new coke to burn.
- You need to lever the freshly made coke over into the heart of the forge. 
- You need to remember to periodically wiggle the clinker breaker to ensure a healthy supply of oxygen.
- If possible, try to lift out larger chunks of clink you find in the bottom of the forge.

> Remember: as the forge burns, ash accumulates in the bottom of the forge, constricting the space your air is moving through. This reduces the size of the heart of the forge, while also making the temperature more difficult to moderate.

A lot of this might seem obvious, but when you are concentrating on forging it can be easy to forget some of these points until they become a problem. Taking a few minutes to manage your fire can make a huge difference!

### Starting the Forge
1. Gather the largest coke chunks from the previous operation
2. Empty out the ash trap below the forge.
3. Ensure the blower is off and the "throttle" is at 0%
	1. If you are inside, ensure your ventilation system is on (coal smoke is Very Carcinogenic)
4. Grab two big handfulls of charcoal and put them into the bottom of the forge
5. Blast the charcoal with an oxy-acetylene blow torch until you see glowy bits
6. Pile your coke chunks on top
7. Turn on the blower and start to open up the throttle
	1. You will see sparks flying out - these are from the charcoal
8. Continue to add your coke and monitor the status of the fire
9. Once you are out of coke and the fire is up and running, start piling coal on the rear corner
10. Moderate your throttle as needed
