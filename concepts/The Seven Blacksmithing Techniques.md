There are seven basic skills in blacksmithing
1. Drawing
2. Upsetting
3. Bending
4. Punching
5. Cutting
6. Twisting
7. Welding

## Drawing
This is when you "draw" the metal out into a thinner form. If you are creating a taper or a fishtail, you are performing a draw. When drawing, you'll want to start working on the part that will be the thinnest first. With each subsequent heat, you can move your starting point a little further back. If you need to make a really big taper, don't be afraid to use the horn or corner of the anvil. You can always straighten up the lines after you have the length.

## Upsetting
This is when you smoosh metal down so that it is thicker. You can do this by hitting the other end of some stock with a hammer on your anvil, dropping a piece of heavier stock onto your anvil, or even putting the stock into a vise and banging it with your hammer. All of these (if the end is hot) will upset the metal.

## Bending
Bending is when you... bend the metal. Okay maybe this didn't need its own heading. Sue me (please don't). Don't forget that you can bend stuff in the vise (especially if you have a bending fork handly).

## Punching
Punching is when you use a tool called a punch to make a hole or slot in metal. When punching, you will want to hit your punch into the metal until the part undearneath is thin enough to essentially cool off instantly.

When this happens, flip the metal over and position over the hole in your anvil (you might need a bolster plate depending on the size of the hole and the size of your punch). It should be super obvious where the punch was going through. Then, punch through on that spot while the metal is still relatively cool. This last bit is essential because we need the metal to be cool enough that it shears instead of bends (trust me, you will be very sad when your beautiful object is horribly deformed).

## Cutting
Cutting is when you use a tool like a cutting chisel to, well, cut the metal. When cutting, be sure to start with just a single line to get starter. If you make a mistake, don't be afraid to flip the item over and try again!

Once you have your starting point, you want to "walk" your tool down the length of the cut, striking the end on each "step". After you repeat this a couple of times, be sure to break out the cutting plate because you will be very sad if you bang your cutting chisel directly onto the anvil (the anvil generally wins this one, in case you are wondering). 

## Twisting
Twisting is pretty self explanitory: it's when you twist the metal (probably in a vise unless you have super-human grip strength). The most important thing to pay attention to here is how you position your work in the vise.

You want to be sure to protect any delicate pieces. If you are twisting a weld, position the weld in the vise such that the jaws are smoothing the weld tighter together (is possible). You also want to try to maximize surface contact with the vise (although this is just good advice for using this tool in general).

## Welding
This technique is the most complicated and so I've created a [separate page](./Forge%20Welding.md) for it.
