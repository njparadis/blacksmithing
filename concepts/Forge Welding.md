To forge weld you need two things:
- Very high heat (to the point the steel is almost burning)
- Flux to dissolve the oxide and prevent formation during the weld

The process to weld is generally:
1. Shape your metal into the pre-weld configuration
	1. Be sure to leave a small gap to allow flux to coat the entire weld surface
2. Heat your pre-shaped metal to orange color
3. Cover the weld zone in flux
4. Return the item to the forge and heat to yellow temp
5. Using quick light blows, forge the metal together
	1. Once the metal is orange temp, re-flux and return to the forge
6. Repeat this process 3-5 times
7. Scrape scale and check the status of the weld

The key to a successful weld is preparation; the specifics of which depend on the type of weld you need to make.

> Important! - whenever you are working metal and you are creating a seam, it is a weld. If you are performing a weld you MUST use flux to prevent impurities from entering the weld and creating inclusions (AKA weak points in the weld).

## Self Welds
These welds are when you take a piece of material and bend it back upon itself. There are a few different types:

### Flush welds
These are welds where the ends are flush with one another. Think of a U where we smashed the sides flush together, leaving a small loop at the bottom. These are very straightforward, just fucking bend that shit, flux it, and go to town.

### Center? Adjacent? welds
These are welds where we bend back one end into the center of the stock (like the letter P). For these welds, we need to add a "scarf" onto the end to ensure a smooth surface at the end. A scarf in this context is a slight point on the end.

#### Why do we need a scarf?
There is a process called "suck" which causes the material we are smooshing together to be "sucked" away from the weld. If we did not use a scarf, then at the end we would have a small trench sort of thing at the bottom of the weld, and we can't have that.

Once the scarf is in place, bend into place and start welding!

### Chain link welds
These are honestly a total bitch to make. Mine came out horrible and uneven. But that's beside the point.

You start with round stock and bend into a U. Then, you need to add opposing scarves on each end. To do this, position the U on the anvil slightly diagonally, such that one end is sticking off the bottom, and the other is fully on the anvil (the "weight bearing" tine). Use half-faced blows to form the scarf and repeat for the other tine. The resulting scarfs should be angled inwards. Bend them 90ยบ into place and begin welding.

During the weld iself, be sure to alternate using the top and the horn of the anvil to ensure you are welding thoroughly.
