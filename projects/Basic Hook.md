## Tools
- Hammer
- Anvil

## Materials
Start with square stock (we used 3/8ths)

## Instructions
1. Taper one end (this will become the hooked end)
2. OPTIONAL: add accents, such as
	1. Twist the stock
	2. Shape the other end into a point to later flatten into a simple leaf
3. Form the tapered end into a hook
	1. Bend the tip away from the hook direction into a volute
	2. Bend the rest of the tapered end into the hook
4. Put a shoulder on the same side as the hook and work into a flattened disc
