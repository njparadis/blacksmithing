## Tools
- Hammer
- Anvil
- Vise
- Cutting chisel
- Cutting plate
- Hole punch
- Bolster plate

## Materials
Rectangle stock (we used 5/8 by 3/16)

## Instructions
1. Taper one end of the rectangle stock
2. Using the cutting chisel, make a mark in the middle of the top of the taper
3. Slowly walk the chisel down the length of the taper
4. Repeat until the taper is cut in half
	1. When you are close to cutting through, be sure to put the cutting plate beneath
	2. Else, you will OBLITERATE the chisel on the anvil and it will be very sad
	3. *Note*: for a cleaner cut, flip the item over at the end and do a back cut at the base of the split
5. Work the two tines apart
	1. Convenience bends are essential here
6. Shape the tines into a shape, such as:
	1. Heart
	2. Rams horns
	3. Plant tendrils
	4. Be creative!
7. Punch two holes below the split tines using punch
	1. *Note*: No need for tongs on the anvil here, just lay on top
	2. *Note*: Have your punch and bolster plate ready to go before you heat
	3. Start with a footprint from the punch before going for the full monty
	4. When the metal biscuit is compressed enough, your hammer will bounce back
	5. At this point, flip the piece over and position punch where you see the biscuit
	6. Tap a couple of times, then thwack once to seat punch
	7. Move to bolster plate and sheer off the biscuit (steel needs to be COOL)
8. Spread the other end into a fish tail
9. Curl into a volute (decide which side looks better and curl the other way)
10. Curl the volute'd fish tail into a nice wide hook, perfect for something like a scarf :D
