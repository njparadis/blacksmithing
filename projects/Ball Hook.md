## Tools
- Hammer
- Anvil
- Rounded punch
- Vise

## Materials
Start with 3/8in square stock

## Instructions
1. Upset one end of the stock up to desired ball size
	1. There are many ways to do this
	2. In class, I used the vise to hold the steep and banged the heated end with my hammer
	3. If the stock bends instead of upsetting, be sure to take time to reforge
2. Put adjacent shoulders below the upset portion of the stock
3. Working on the side of the anvil, work the isolated portion into a ball shape
	1. Remember to protect the shoulders
	2. Rotate/move the stock constantly to create the sphere
4. Taper the part below the ball slightly for the hook
5. Forge a [leaf](./Leaf.md) on the other end
6. Use the rounded punch to put a spot for a fastener hole slightly below the leaf stem
	1. Can angle the punch slightly between hammer blows to widen the space
7. Bend the leaf to one side
8. Bend the ball end into a hook
