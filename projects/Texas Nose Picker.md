## Tools
- Hammer
- Anvil
- Setter punch
- Vise
- Cutting wedge
- Twisting wrench

## Materials
Start with at least 12in of 3/8 square stock - put marks @ 6in and 12in

## Instructions
1. Taper the first 6in out to 12in (double in length)
2. Flatten the stock between the 6in and 12in marks into rectangle stock (about 3/16 by 7/16)
	1. Consider putting a convenience bend on the taper
	2. Leave a little bit of untouched square stock between the taper and the rectangle (we need for the twist later)
3. Cut off excess stock
4. Put a shoulder on the cut end ~1 hammer width in
5. Work the material above the shoulder out to about 3.5-4 inches (keeping it square)
6. Knock the corners on the shoulder-ey bit and then bend out to ~45ยบ angle
7. Work the little shoulder bit into a volute curved toward the crook (vs toward the former shoulder)
8. Work the rest of the shoulder bit into a loop
9. Heat the rectangle stock and twist, taking care to protect the loop in the vise
10. Remove the convenience bend from the taper and begin to work into an S shape
	1. no more than 180ยบ bend on the top of the S
11. Put the S into the vise, pointy bit down with the middle of the S flush with the top of the vise
12. At the same time, gently bend and tap the taper into the desired handed-ness
	1. Hit on left and bend to right for right handed
	2. This step is done cold
