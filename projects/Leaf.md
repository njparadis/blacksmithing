## Tools
- Hammer
- Anvil

## Materials
Start with square stock (we used 3/8in)

## Instructions
1. Forge an end into a point
2. Put adjacent shoulders ~1 hammer width from the top
	1. More material = longer leaf
3. Work the shoulders out into a taper to form the stem
4. Slightly flatten the end to begin forming the leaf
5. Using the peen, work the flattened bit into a wider shaper
	1. You can always flip the leaf over if things are uneven
6. Continue to work with the peen to move material into a leaf shape
	1. __Always__ start in the middle of the leaf
	2. Work from the tip to the stem
