## Tools
- Hammer
- Anvil
- Vise

## Materials
Start with rectangle stock (we used 5/8 by 3/16)

## Instructions
1. Put opposing shoulders into one end of the stock, leaving a square of material above
2. Work the isolated square into a circle
3. Taper the portion below the circle slightly
4. Repeat on the other end
	1. Check symmetry with a sizer
5. Put one end into the vise, taking care that some of the taper is in the jaws
6. Bang that shit with your hammer to put two bends in at once
	1. Hit the steel where you want the handle to start coming away from the future door
7. Repeat for the other side
8. Make any additional adjustments to ensure the handle lays correctly
	1. Put on anvil and apply pressure with a tong handle to a circle to see if the handle pops up
	2. If so, put the circle off the side of anvil and give a couple taps with hammer (COLD)
	3. Repeat until the handle lays properly
