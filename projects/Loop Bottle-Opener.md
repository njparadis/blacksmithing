1. Put a shoulder ~1 hammer width from the end of the stock
2. Work the shoulder out into square stock

4. Put the stock into the vise and work the tine till it's perpendicular to the stock
5. Curl tine into volute away from the main body
6. Curl tine into big loop towards the main body
7. Using a flat punch positioned with part off the stock, form the lip of the opener
8. OPTIONAL: add texture to the handle portion
	1. Try ball peen for a sort of ice/scaled texture
	2.  Otherwise the standard peen works great :)
9. Widen the bottom end
10. Curl the bottom end under
11. Lay the item on the anvil face up and give it a whack just below the opener part
	1. This is to give the item better ergonomics
